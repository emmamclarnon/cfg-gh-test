      <h3>Seven Arts</h3>

        <p>
          This bar is a not-for-profit, independent arts space.  First set up in 2007, it hosts a range of live music
          and comedy, as well as
          <a href="http://www.cafescientifique.org/index.php?option=com_contentbuilder&title=uk-leeds-chapel-allerton&controller=details&id=1&record_id=127&Itemid=478&limitstart=0&filter_order=">Cafe Scientifique</a>
           and art exhibitions. As well as being an arts space, it also serves great food and delicious beers.
         </p>


          <h3>LS6 Cafe</h3>
          <p> One of the oldest cafes in Leeds, LS6 has nursed many a hangover through the medium of breakfast.
            It sources food locally and ensures it comes from sustainable suppliers and farms.  Supporting local business
            and a Sunday film night with an emphasis on social issues, what's not to love?</p>

            <h3>  Nichols Vegetarian Delicatessen</h3>

            <p> Offering vegetarian and vegan options since 2012, this small dwelling has lots to offer those who
              wish to eat non-animal alternatives.  Situated in Chapel Allerton, it offers a pleasant place for lunch or dinner
              out of the buzz of the city.
            </p>

            <h3>  Inkwell Arts</h3>
            <p>
              A safe and creative art space with a focus on postive mental health experiences, this cafe is ran by
              volunteers and staff.  It offers a selection of vegetarian and vegan food for those who are taking a class, or
              those who want to pop in for a coffee and sandwich.
